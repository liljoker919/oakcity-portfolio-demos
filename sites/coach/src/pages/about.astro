        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
          I didn't start as the "fit person." I was overweight, unmotivated, and struggling with confidence. 
          After my own transformation, I realized my purpose: helping others break through the same barriers 
          I once faced.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
          For over 10 years, I've helped hundreds of clients transform not just their bodies, but their entire 
          approach to health, fitness, and life. I understand the challenges because I've lived them. And I know 
          what it takes to succeed because I've been there.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
          My coaching philosophy is simple: sustainable results through individualized programming, honest 
          communication, and unwavering support. No gimmicks, no quick fixes—just proven strategies that work.
